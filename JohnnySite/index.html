                            <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
                            <p>I was a kid in the 80’s.  My dad would let me stay up late to watch pulpy sci-fi like Logan’s Run and Doctor Who. It made me feel special because my brothers were fast asleep while I enjoyed the company of my dad who spent most of his time working.  One of my earliest, clear memories was watching a VHS copy of David Lynch’s Dune.  I can remember seeing Herbert’s paperback version in my dad’s overfilled library, snatching it, and reading it cover-to-cover over the course of two days.  At a tender age when my friends were playing in the mud with GI Joes, I was folding space on a Guild Highliner:  The sleeper had awakened.
             
                             
                                 
                            </p>

                                 <p>    Now, I imagine worlds that I try to bring into reality through writing, sculpture, painting, drawing, teaching, photography, and film.  Using fiction in design is a way for me to share my vision of the future with others.  The storytellers are the shapers of reality; I try to add my two cents.  Storytellers like Lynch, Kubrick, Clarke, Heinlein, Herbert, Dali, and Bucky Fuller are among those who have inspired my work.</p>

                            <p> The advent of affordable DSLR’s and consumer editing software has allowed me to explore filmmaking in a way that my 10-year-old self would have killed for. The democratization of filmmaking is the best thing that has ever happened to me (maybe second to my marriage to a fantastic human, and the birth of my sons) because it has allowed me to finally bring the stories of my imagination out of pre-production.</p>

                    <p>I have always believed that breaking students out of the daily grind of school is the best way to make a long term impact on their education.  Field trips centered on art experiences such as museum or studio visits and workshops become embedded in the memory of students that will endure for a lifetime.  Increasing the positive instances between a learner and art is the key to unlocking the hidden artist in each student.  This belief has led me to bring students to my alma mater, The Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design and to museums like the Milwaukee Art Museum, The Walker, The Minneapolis Institute of Art, The Lynden Sculpture Garden, The Hamilton Wood Type Museum, The Rahr West Art Museum, The John Michael Kohler Center for the Arts, and the Kohler Design Center.  I’ve brought students to meet artists in their studios to see how artists work as well as to make art with several artists.  They’ve created tintype murals, wood cut prints, blown glass sculptures, found objects sculptures, embroidery, woven pieces, collages, and drawings with several artists who work in Wisconsin or who are visiting from other states or countries.  In each experience I have witnessed, first-hand, the transformative effects that art has made on the lives of the students.  </p>

                        <p>This class will study and practice the many aspects of making a narrative film including set design, screenwriting, casting, location scouting, storyboarding, lighting, directing, acting, editing, effects, music, and marketing. Design research and Design thinking techniques will be employed by the students to ideate and create their own world in which a story takes place. Students will explore the fundamentals of composition through narrative photography. </p>

                        <p>Finding an interesting piece of fallen tree has always been an enjoyable experience for me.  I collect them on beaches, in forests, and in ditches beside roads.  Combining this compulsion with my vision of a possible future, my ideas of design fiction, forms the basis of these asteroid carvings.  Raw materials like wood were exploited by early lumber barons in much the same way I imagine future space barons like Elon Musk and Jeff Bessos will exploit resources found in asteroids.  The similarities between trees and asteroids seem myriad when viewed from a futurist’s perspective.  </p>

                    <p>00A.P.81.7 is a typical narrow hallway in a warren-like subterranean world.  But one feature makes this corridor unique; it boasts a vent set into its overhead that connects to a bright place above filled with the sound of birds chirping and children laughing.  From that vent drifts an occasional stream of fine soil that forms a squat pile on the bleak deck.   Impressed by the new sounds and smells emanating from the vent  a lowly worker decides to keep the treasure of the soil.  He pours it into his steel nutrient cup, mixing it with the slimy leftovers of his last meal to make a moldable paste.  The worker fashions a sculpture from the soil that sprouts a tiny green plant, the first bit of green the worker has ever seen. But an ever present Artificial Intelligence notices a discrepancy.  It orders the worker to return the soil or face death. But he cannot bring himself to throw the new life into the recycler.   </p>

                    <h2 class="tag">Scope: Film</h2>
                    <p>SPiN is the story of a boy who lives on a nearly abandoned generation ship who explores the overgrown habitat. While the boy plays, a pilot leaves the ship aboard a smaller vessel.  She seeks to bring a massive and mysterious artifact back to her home for an encounter with the curious boy. 

                            In this film, I’m exploring the importance of the imagination of youth.  The boy who plays in the forest, surrounded by nature that becomes the backdrop of his own creative play becomes the puppeteer of a darker, more technological activity.  He pretends to pilot a ship in space as an actual pilot navigates in space.  This juxtaposition suggests that the child is manifesting his own imagination.  The final encounter between the child and the object represents the conflict between youthful imagination and adult memory.  
                            
                            Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001 as told by Stanley Kubric really inspired some of the motifs in SPiN.  Specifically, my own memory of watching 2001 as a child is skewed through the lens I’ve developed as an adult.  It’s tough for me to describe the emotion or sense of that experience which leads to the necessity of my film.
